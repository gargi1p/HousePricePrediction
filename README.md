# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. It uses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

## 📊 Overview

The notebook includes:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Visualization and correlation analysis  
- Model training (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)  
- Performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, R²  

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used includes features like:
- Area
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Location
- Price (target variable)
